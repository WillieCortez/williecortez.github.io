	<h1>THE ROCKS STORE</h1
<p>Welcome To The Rocks Store - where you can buy any kind of Rock that you can ever think of.  <br/> Whether it's a moon rock, martian rock, a rock the size of The Empire State building or a little tiny river rock. <br/> If we don't have it, we'll go to the moon, the next planet, or the next galaxy to get it for you!</p>
